# YALURIDE Database Migration Deployment Script
#
# This script automates the deployment of database migrations to a Supabase project.
#
# It is designed to be used in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI).
# It requires two pieces of information:
# 1. The Supabase Project ID, passed as the first command-line argument.
# 2. The Supabase Access Token, provided as an environment variable `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-database.sh <your-supabase-project-id>
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Supabase CLI installed (`npm install supabase --save-dev`).
#   - The script must be run from the repository root.
#   - Ensure you have execute permissions: `chmod +x scripts/deploy-database.sh`
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# This ensures that the script will fail fast if any step has an error.
